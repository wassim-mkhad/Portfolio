# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and experience in data analysis. Each project has its own folder, which includes a file with a description of the project, storytelling with code, and a file with the code script.

## Projects

**Project 1: World Bank's International Debt Analysis**

An analysis of international debt data collected by The World Bank providing information about the amount of money that the World Bank has lent to countries across several categories from 1970 to 2018. This project was done using **SQL**

## About Me
